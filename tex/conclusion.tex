\section{Concluding Remarks}
  This paper continues the analysis of the interaction of the packet-scale 
  paradigm with traffic burstiness. This analysis relies on a first-principles 
  approach to gain several simple but fundamental insights on the influence of 
  network, traffic, and protocol parameters on the efficiency of the paradigm.

  We have found that the insights obtained in \cite{Lovewell2011-Noise-TR} 
  hold when we treat $RTT$ as a random variable and when we treat $T_{on}$, 
  $T_{off}$, $R_{on}$ as random variables.
