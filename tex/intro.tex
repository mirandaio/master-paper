\section{Introduction}
  The packet-scale congestion control is a newly proposed framework for 
  congestion control that promises to scale up the state of the art in 
  ultra-high speed congestion control by several orders of magnitude.

  This paper is a continuation of the analysis of the impact of cross traffic 
  burstiness in the packet-scale paradigm \cite{Lovewell2011-Noise-TR}. We 
  consider two scenarios 
  for the cross traffic. In one scenario, the cross traffic parameters are 
  constant and the RTT is treated as a random variable. In the second 
  scenario, the RTT is held constant throughout the connection and cross 
  traffic parameters are treated as random variables.
